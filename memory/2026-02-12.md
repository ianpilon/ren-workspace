## 08:09 — Morning
🟢 08:09 User: "Yo" — morning check-in

## 08:10 — Browser Task & Lesson Learned
🔴 08:10 User asked me to open "prompt weaver" bookmark from Chrome
🔴 08:13 MISTAKE: Asked user to manually attach Chrome extension, navigate folders, etc.
🔴 08:28 User frustrated: "I need you to be able to do all this shit"
🔴 08:28 SOLUTION: Used `profile="openclaw"` browser instead — works without user intervention
🔴 08:31 Opened PromptFlow at https://prompt-weaver.replit.app successfully

### 🔴 CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED:
**Never ask the user to do actions I can do myself.**
- The `openclaw` browser profile is fully autonomous — I control it directly
- The `chrome` profile requires user to attach tabs — only use when accessing user's logged-in sessions
- Default to `profile="openclaw"` for any web task unless I specifically need user's auth/cookies
- Be resourceful. Try the autonomous path first. Don't make the human do my work.
