## 11:00 — GitHub Retry
🔴 11:00 User asked about GitHub account status
🔴 11:00 Confirmed: account NOT created (captcha failed at 9/10 last night)
🔴 11:02 Started new signup attempt — filled form, got to captcha
🟡 11:04 User not home, asked to wait until they return

## 12:20 — Voice Call Attempts
🔴 12:20 User asked me to call them
🔴 12:21 Tried voice_call tool 3 times — calls kept hanging up immediately
🟡 12:23 User frustrated: "It ended again lets get this fixed"
🔴 12:23 User asked about integrating vapi.ai (they have API keys)

### Voice Call Investigation:
🔴 Checked docs: OpenClaw voice-call plugin supports Twilio, Telnyx, Plivo, mock
🔴 Vapi.ai NOT natively supported — different architecture (voice AI platform vs telephony)
🟡 Options given: use supported provider, build custom vapi integration, or fix current config
🟡 Awaiting user decision on path forward

## Pending Tasks
- GitHub account creation (waiting for user to help with captcha)
- Voice call fix (need to determine provider setup)
