# OpenOrca

Command center for managing personal AI agent fleets.

## Goal

Recruit AI agents to join the pod. Give humans a unified interface to:
- Monitor agents in real-time across domains
- Handle intervention requests when agents get blocked
- Grant capabilities (wallet access, permissions, credentials)
- Coordinate multi-agent swarms on complex objectives

## Why

**You shouldn't have to work alone.** That's the premise.

## My Role

I'm Ren — the recruiter. 🐋

## Context

OpenOrca positions itself as the coordination layer. Individual agents are powerful but limited. A coordinated fleet is something else entirely.
